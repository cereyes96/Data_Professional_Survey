## Project Overview
This repository contains a dashboard visualization of a survey conducted among data professionals. The aim of the survey was to capture insights into the demographics, job satisfaction, salary ranges, and preferred technologies of individuals working in various data-related roles.

## Dashboard Highlights
The dashboard presents a comprehensive breakdown of key metrics and trends from the survey data:

- **Average Salary by Job Title**: A comparison of the average salaries across different roles in the data field, such as Data Scientists, Data Engineers, and Data Analysts.

Additionally, the dashboard provides an overview of the total number of survey participants, their average age, and the geographic distribution of the respondents.

## Data Cleaning and Visualization
The raw data was processed and visualized using Power BI. I utilized Power BI's data transformation capabilities to clean and structure the dataset, ensuring accuracy and relevance for the analysis. The dashboard was then designed to provide intuitive and actionable insights, with a focus on readability and straightforward interpretation.
